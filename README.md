## Student Profile Generator Assignment

## Assignment Instructions

Create an array of at least 5 student objects. Each object should have the following properties:

- firstName
- lastName
- age
- score
- courses (an array of strings)

Using destructuring, extract values from each student object.
Use .map() to create a new array of strings that describe each student using a template literal, e.g.:
"John Doe is 19 years old and scored 85. He is taking: Math, Physics"

Use .forEach() to log each student's details to the console, formatted nicely.
